This file describes the changes to the software actually being implemented
and not yet included in the public distribution. It also decsribes the known
problems and bugs. (Updated 2 February 2006).

0) Tholen has been working on Windows compilation, with Compaq Visual Fortran
   6.6c. 

iers_ser.f90  gmsnom has undefined stuff thus the call 

comp_heart_ta_shift.f90 should USE critical_points_shift 
matrixdat_ta_shift


problems with the quadp library....

1) Milani has been working to fix the radar residuals problem of NEODyS.
   Changes are being appplied to the 3.3.1 version running under neodys@newton
   and under orbmaint@piazzi.  Recently (after last 3.3.1 merge, 15/11/2005)
   changed files:

updated in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2:
./src/propag/ephem_prop.f90 (fsteph wrong) 
(neofit not affected because option time series not used anymore)
./conf/mf.intelhifi.d, .O (compilation with IEEE754 compliance)
./src/suit/io_elems.f90 (fix to problem when ML format does not contain COV)
./src/suit/astrometric_observations.f90 (use of accurate Earth rotation always)
./src/propag/pred_obs.f90 (correction to r_rdot for higher order relativistic)
                          (in 3.3.1 remove test output of obspos)
./src/fitobs/fitobs.f90 (in 3.3.1 remove test output of resid.)
./lib/ephemn.key (input iers.key)
./lib/RADCODE.dat (corrected pos. of Arecibo and Goldstone DSS13)

2) Milani has been working to the new orbit identification algorithm. Also,
   the new algorithm step_fit to upgrade a constrained orbit to a full least
   square one.  Also, the arc type computation and the new qualities,
   motivated byt he new defibnition of discovery. Changes have been applied to
   the 3.3.2 version running under orbmaint@piazzi; they affect directories
   ./src/idconf2 and ./src/allobs (but also ./src/propag, with
   least_squares.f90 and multiple_sol.f90 containing experimental software).
   Recently (after previous 3.3.2 merge, 1/2/2006) changed files:


Feb  9 19:45 Makefile
Feb 10 16:10 allobs/ufitobs5.f90
Feb 11 09:52 allobs/arc_control.f90
Feb 13 16:57 propag/multiple_sol.f90
Feb 13 17:21 allobs/ufitobs4.f90
Feb 13 19:05 idconf2/idcheck3.f90
Feb 15 15:47 idconf2/identmul_input.f90
Feb 16 09:01 suit/astrometric_observations.f90  ????????

3) Milani and Gronchi have been working to the Panstarrs simulations. The
   "orphan" software is still in alpha-testing. Changes have been applied to
   the 3.3.2 version running under orbmaint@adams; they affect mostly the
   directory ./src/triang, but there are distribution changes. Recently (after
   previous 3.3.2 merge, 1/2/2006) changed files:


4) Gronchi and Tommei have been working on the new MOID regularization and
   uncertainty estimation. This should affect only the ./src/moid directory,
   later will affect ./src/neodys and the online NEODyS.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

1) Documentation: the project of a "Mathematical Specification" document has
   been abandoned, to be replaced by Milani and Gronchi, "Orbit
   Determination", Cambridge University Press 2008, 400 pages. But this use of
   \futurecite is not nice. Any idea?

2) References. A serious work in providing references could to a large extent
   replace the ad hoc documentation. Just our own papers are dozens. The
   problem is how to link the subrotuines, and the algorithms used in them, to
   the references. Possible to use some BiBTeX machinery?

2) Cometary orbits. The module ever_pitkin is now quite stable, even if the
   "universal" variables are NOT universal (unless we have a computer with
   infinite mantissa). Still observing a Sun-grazing comet while very far from
   the Sun is not possible numerically, for our good luck it is also
   impossible astronomically. The problem of non gravitational perturbations 
   is still unsolved in our code.
