DIRECTORY INFO
In this directory we develop the computation of the moid using the
true anomalies.  
The resultant is factorized in a product o a 4 degree pol. by a 16
degree pol.

MAIN PROGRAMS:

***********************
min_comp_ta_shift.f90
***********************
This program tests the routine compute_minima_ta.f90,
that is used in src/propag by moid_compute.f90 and by clo_app.f90 
the main is also used in th test performed tests/moid/ 

***********************
statcomp_ta_shift.f90
***********************
This program compute the MOID between an orbit, given with cometary
elements, and the orbit of the Earth.
The elements of the asteroid/comet are given in the file comelems.dat
having this format q e Inc Omnod omega
the flag wri_mat allows to write the result on the flat file stat_data
HINT! the time t1 of the elements is given by hand in the main program

******************
ast2ast_moid.f90
******************
This program computes the MOID between pairs of asteroid orbits

************************** 
stat_search_ta_shift.f90
************************** 
Needed for large scale numerical experiments, allows to compute the
MOID between two whatever orbits, whose cometary elements are given in
the file orbit_cometary.dat

***************
statcomp3.f90 
***************
This program is used by NEODyS to compute the MOID between an asteroid
orbit and the orbit of the Earth. It uses as input the elements in the
epoch/ directory
