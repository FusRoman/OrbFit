<B>Warning</B></FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH=60%>The OrbFit software system is
now undergoing a major upgrade. Starting from version 3.0 it will be
written in a different language, namely Fortran90. The change does not
only involve the free format of the source code: the new versions
will exploit the main features of Fortran90, especially user defined
data types and modules. This change is necessary for two reasons: (1)
to allow an easier software maintenance, given the serious manpower
problems of the consortium and the number of requests for
improvements/bug fixes we receive (2) to allow for substantial
generalizations of the code, such as the ones required to allow for
observation weighing based on statistical analysis of past observatory
performance, and determination of orbits in different coordinate
systems. 
</P>

<P>
The procedure is as follows: the distribution 2.3 has been the last in
Fortran77. We will keep distributing patches 2.3.x to this
distribution.  

 if we should release the software version 3.0 at some lower
level of reliability, as beta-test version, to receive input from the
public users, rather than waiting for the end of tests performed by a
few recipients of a private preliminary version.
</P>

<P>
The patch 2.3.3 is indeed available for UNIX users. It contains fixes
to several bugs, either found by us or reported by users, including
the infamous "polar bug" by which the Orbfit predictions were
unreliable at declinations close to 90 deg. We are sorry, but we are
currently not equipped for providing upgrades to the Windows version;
more exactly, we do not want to be equipped, by paying a tax to
Microsoft to be allowed to provide free software.
</P>

<P>The next distribution 3.1 is in the new language, now available
as beta-test. However, this will be a really big change in the
software, and it is reasobale to assume that this will imply a
difficult testing procedure. We need to be assisted by
the users to perform an in depth debugging.
