Where to find additional documentation?</H3>
Additional documentation is available in the form of online technical papers.
It can be accessed in one of two ways.
<UL>
<LI>
You can reach it on your own computer in the <TT><A
HREF="additional_doc/index.html">./doc/additional_doc</A></TT>
directory . However, it is not automatically included in the
documentation for the full OrbFit distribution; if you have not
downloaded it yet, you should get the archive from the <TT><A
HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/documentation/">documentation</A></TT>
directory: get the file <TT>additional_doc.tar.gz,</TT> and unpack it
in the root OrbFit directory.


<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
If you do not wish to download the additional documentation
immediately, you may browse the information on the World Wide Web by
pointing your browser to
&nbsp; <A HREF="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/OrbFit/doc/additional_doc/">
<TT>http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/OrbFit/doc/additional_doc/</TT>.</A></LI>
