This contains the plans for the immediate future of ORBFIT, that is
the improvements we are either working on, or at least thinking to.

Category 0: things being done now:


Category 1: things almost ready, expected for the next release:

1) Star maps superimposed on observation predictions.  This requires
to use gnuplot 2.7, not yet available under some Operating Systems.

2) Light version without JPL ephemerides. 

3) Yarkovsky effect.  Already available non documented feature, not
properly tested.

Category 2: things needed, not yet scheduled:

1) Multiple solution from Gauss's preliminary orbit.

2) Processing of satellite observations not yet reduced to geocenter. 
Also roving observer.

3) Cometary version, with support for non gravitational perturbations
and hyperbolic/parabolic orbits. 

4) More readable output files, in particular the log files,
runname.fou, runname.olg, but also runname.fga, etc.

Category 3: things under consideration:

1) Recovery planning. 

2) Observation planning. 

3) Uncertainty of predictions from very short arcs.  

4) Integration with Holvorcem's software.
